# Laravel Expense Manager

A simple Laravel application that tracks expenses.

## Default Admin Account

For your convenience, a default admin account has been set up with the following credentials:

- **Email:** admin@email.com
- **Password:** Pass@123

Please use these credentials to access the administrator privileges and manage the application as specified in the requirements.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Laravel 10

### Frontend

- Vue 3 with Vite
- Inertia

## Features

- User Management
- User Roles and Permissions
- Expense Management
- Keeps track of userâ€™s expenses
- Dashboard
- Display chart of total expense per category

> **Note:** When adding a new user, the default password is set to **Pass@1234**. This is set because the requirements and the UI did not contain a password field.

> **Important:** Deleting an expense category will throw an error if there is an expense currently using it as a category. In such cases, the expense category that is being used must be deleted or updated to a different category before the original category can be deleted. Please ensure that you handle this situation accordingly to maintain data integrity.
